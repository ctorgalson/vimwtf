Welcome to VimWTF?. It's a blog about using the incredible but arcane [Vim text
editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29). There are
[lots of other Vim blogs](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vim+blog) like [usevim](http://usevim.com) (not to
mention the
amazing [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/)), so you might think there's no
huge reason to start another one. You'd be right except for one
thing–those blogs don't help me remember the things I've recently
learned how to do in Vim. With any luck, writing the posts in this one
will. Besides that, I needed an excuse to work with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

As for the name, whatever else you think of it, it's hard to deny Vim is a tool that produces a lot of "WTF?" moments–at least during the learning process.

That's it for the justification. With any luck since you're reading
this, there'll be something here for you to take away that you didn't already know.
Welcome. WTF?
